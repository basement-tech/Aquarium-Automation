# Aquarium-Automation
OK, this is the first post from the basement tech Aquarium Automation project.
This project aims to automate some of the operations required to maintain a large
aquarium like water level top-off.

I'll fill in a lot more details as I get on with the project.

I'll start with some of the code related to feasibility and put that in the
"Feasibility" section of this repository.

Stay tuned !
